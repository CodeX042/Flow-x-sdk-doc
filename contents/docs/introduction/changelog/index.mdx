## SDK Modules Overview

The FlowX SDK contains modules for specific tasks. Below is a high-level overview:

---

### **Client Module**
The `Client` module provides the main interface for interacting with FlowX's APIs.

#### **Initialize the Client**
Set up the FlowX client by providing your API key:

```python
from flowx_sdk.client import Client
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")
```

### **Fetch Supported Currencies**
Retrieve the list of currencies supported by FlowX:

```python
currencies = client.get_supported_currencies()
print(currencies)
```
### **Send Payment**
Send a stablecoin-based payment:

```python
payment = client.send_payment(
    sender_wallet="your_sender_wallet_address",
    receiver_wallet="receiver_wallet_address",
    amount="100.00",
    currency="USD"
)
print(payment)
```
