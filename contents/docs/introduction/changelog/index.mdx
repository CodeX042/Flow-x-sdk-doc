## SDK Modules Overview

The FlowX SDK contains modules for specific tasks. Below is a high-level overview:

---

### **Client Module**
The `Client` module provides the main interface for interacting with FlowX's APIs.

#### **Initialize the Client**
Set up the FlowX client by providing your API key:

```python
from flowx_sdk.client import Client
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")
```

### **Fetch Supported Currencies**
Retrieve the list of currencies supported by FlowX:

```python
currencies = client.get_supported_currencies()
print(currencies)
```
### **Send Payment**
Send a stablecoin-based payment:

```python
payment = client.send_payment(
    sender_wallet="your_sender_wallet_address",
    receiver_wallet="receiver_wallet_address",
    amount="100.00",
    currency="USD"
)
print(payment)
```

### Error Handling in FlowX SDK

The FlowX SDK provides detailed error messages for smooth debugging.

#### Authentication Errors
Occurs when the API key is invalid or missing:

```python
from flowx_sdk.exceptions import AuthenticationError

try:
    client = Client(api_key="invalid_api_key")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
```

### Payment Errors
Triggered when a payment fails due to insufficient funds, invalid wallet addresses, or network issues:

```python
from flowx_sdk.exceptions import PaymentError

try:
    payment = client.send_payment(
        sender_wallet="your_sender_wallet_address",
        receiver_wallet="receiver_wallet_address",
        amount="100.00",
        currency="USD"
    )
except PaymentError as e:
    print(f"Payment failed: {e}")
```
